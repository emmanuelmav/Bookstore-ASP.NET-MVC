## My process

### Built with

- ASP.NET Core: The framework provides the foundation for building web applications, allowing for efficient handling of HTTP requests, routing, and rendering views.
- Bootstrap 5 - For styles
- SQL SERVER
- C#
- Entity Framework Core: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that simplifies database interactions by mapping database tables to C# objects.

### What I learned

Through building an online bookstore application using the ASP.NET Core framework, I have learned numerous valuable lessons. Firstly, I gained a deep understanding of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern and its implementation in web development. I discovered the importance of properly designing the database schema to efficiently store and retrieve data. Additionally, I developed skills in implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access for different user roles. This project allowed me to sharpen my knowledge of ASP.NET Core, C#, and SQL database management.

### Continued development

Moving forward, there are several areas I could continue to explore and learn in future projects. One aspect is enhancing the user experience by implementing features like real-time notifications, search functionality, and personalized recommendations for users. Additionally, I could delve into implementing advanced security measures like two-factor authentication and role-based access control.
